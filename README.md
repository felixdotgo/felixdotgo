# 👋 Hi, I'm Felix

Backend Engineer focused on scalable systems, SaaS platforms, and developer tools.

I design and build distributed backend services that handle real-world scale — from HR SaaS modules to blockchain marketplaces.  
My work sits at the intersection of system design, performance optimization, and practical AI integration.

### ✍️ Writing  
I share thoughts on backend architecture, database internals, AI integration (LLM + Bedrock), and system design lessons learned from production systems.
