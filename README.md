# 👋 It's good to see you here
I'm a software engineer who loves coding, a passionate learner who's always willing to learn and work across technologies.
Here is a little bit of information about what I'm doing for daily life outside of my 9to5 job.

- My [homelab](https://github.com/0x46656C6978/homelab)
